TELES Eternal Lands Equipment Simulator

About TELES

TELES is a tool designed for the Eternal Lands community. Its goal is making the comparison between different sets of equipments a bit more practical and easier. You'll be able to combine different pieces of armor and weapon, and see the resulting stats instantly (more or less like the #arm command does in game, but without the need of owning the equipment). Note that capes, clothes and damaged versions of armors and weapons are not considered here (they may be in an hypothetical future version).
